1. A machine produces memory sticks of varying lengths, distributed uniformly between 2 and 12 mm. Memory sticks longer than 10 mm do not meet the design criterion, and must be scrapped.

(a) Calculate the probability that a memory stick will be scrapped.
(b) Simulate 50 memory stick lengths and obtain a histogram of the simulated values. Calculate the simulated mean and variance.

2. Students in an electronic engineering laboratory measure current in using an ammeter. Due to several random factors, the measurement X follows the pdf

(a) Show that, for this to be a genuine probability density, b = 0.15.
(b) Find the probability that the measurement of the current exceeds 3 A.
(c) Find E(X).

3. In a radio communications system, the phase difference X between the transmitter and receiver is modeled as having a uniform density in
